Dungeon Hunter is a fast-paced 2D dungeon crawler built in C++ with OpenGL. The game offers two modes — a single-player survival challenge where you battle endless waves of enemies, and a multiplayer mode where two players fight head-to-head in an arena. It combines classic dungeon exploration with combat mechanics, featuring health systems, collisions, and enemy AI that scale in difficulty. With its mix of survival intensity and competitive multiplayer, Dungeon Hunter delivers both replayability and fun for casual players who want a quick challenge and friends looking for a duel.
